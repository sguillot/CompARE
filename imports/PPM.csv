ModelDependencyDescription,"The atmosphere model used in this analysis is the nsx model (Ho and Heinke 2009) available under the form of precalculated tables (see Zenodo associated with Riley et al. 2019).

The ray-tracing model accounting for the trajectory of photons and other effects of gravity adopts the Schwarzschild metric, assumes an oblate neutron star (using the oblateness-frequency relation of AlGendy and Morsink (2014), and includes the Doppler effects. The full ray-tracing model is described in Bogdanov et al. 2019 (Paper II).

The oblateness-frequency relation of AlGendy and Morsink (2014) is EOS-independent. However, it was quantified from nucleonic EOS.  Different interior compositions may affect this relation, and therefore the ray-tracing calculations.

In this analysis, no a-priori background was assumed (see Riley et al. 2019).

For the inference, the multinest sampler was used (Feroz & Hobson 2008, Feroz et al. 2009, Buchner et al. 2014) with the following parameters:  1000 live points, Inverse hypervolume expansion factor (q) 0.8,  Termination condition: 0.1 (see Riley et al. 2019).","The atmosphere model used in this analysis is the nsx model (Ho and Heinke 2009) available under the form of precalculated tables.

In this analysis, no a-priori background was assumed for the NICER data. However, the XMM-Newton phase-averaged spectrum used in the analysis is associated with a background spectrum (measured on the same CCD near the pulsar).  Therefore, in the joint analysis of NICER data with XMM-Newton, the total phase-averaged flux inferred for NICER is constrained by the phase-averaged XMM flux. In practice, this constrains the inferred NICER background. See Riley et al. 2021 for more details. See also Salmi et al. 2022 for more analyses on the NICER background.

AssumptionsDescription,"The ray-tracing model of this analysis (described in Bogdanov et al. 2019, Paper II) assumes general relativity as the theory of gravitation.

At the surface of a neutron star, elements stratify on time scales of minutes/hours leaving the lightest on top (Romani 1987). Also, the thickness of the last scattering layer of a NS is on the order of a few cm. Therefore, it is common to assume a single composition, being that of the lightest element. Hydrogen is therefore a reasonable assumption for the composition, especially for a NS that has accreted matter from a companion star, as is the case for a millisecond pulsar. Other effects are in competition and may put some uncertainties on the surface composition, namely, accretion from the interstellar medium, diffuse nuclear burning of light of H into He (Chang & Bildsten 2003, 2004), and spallation of heavier elements into lighter ones (Bildsten et al. 1992).

The radiative transfer calculations of the atmosphere model were performed assuming full ionisation of the material (i.e., using opacity tables of fully ionised elements).  At the temperatures of the hot spots of millisecond pulsars (0.5-2 x 10^6 K), the neutral fraction may be negligible. See discussion in Bogdanov et al. 2019, Paper II) 

This analyses assumed emission from a low-magnetic field neutron stars as measured  for the dipolar fields of millisecond pulsars (Manchester et al. 2005). The atmosphere model is that of a non-magnetised atmosphere, which is a good approximation as B-field effect (modified opacities) become important above 1e10 G (Kaminker et al., 1983; Zavlin et al., 1996). However, this neglects potential high-magnetic loop near the NS surface.

The modelling of the x-ray absorption (with the tbabs model) assumes solar abundances for the interstellar medium.

The assumed spot geometrical pattern of this analysis was ST-PDT: Single-temperature + Protruding Single-Temperature, i.e., a circular spot (ST) with a crescent-shape spot (PST, i.e., with the 'inner' temperature consistent with zero); See Riley et al. 2019 for a description of the geometrical spot patterns.  Note that simpler spot patterns (e.g., two circular spots) were not statistically preferred (Riley et al. 2019).

This analysis ignored the possible presence of non-thermal emission from the millisecond pulsar. However, in the energy range used for the analysis (0.25-3.0 keV), non-thermal emission is unlikely to have a significant contribution (see for e.g., Guillot et al. 2016). Moreover, no such thermal emission has been detected in the X-ray spectrum of this pulsar (Bogdanov et al. 2008)

The radio timing of the pulsar provided a prior on the pulsar distance (325 +/- 9 pc), see Arzoumanian et al 2018.

A prior on the interstellar absorption was used in this analysis, with a neutron hydrogen column density Nh in the range 0 to 5x10^20 cm^-2, i.e, a flat prior (Riley et al. 2019).","The ray-tracing model of this analysis (described in Bogdanov et al. 2019, Paper II) assumes general relativity as the theory of gravitation.

The assumed spot geometrical pattern of this analysis was that of two oval spots (allowed to overlap partially or fully), see Miller et al. 2019.

The assumed spot geometrical pattern of this analysis was STU: Single-temperature unshared, i.e., two circular spots (not overlapping); See Riley et al. 2019 ans Riley et al. 2021 for a description of the geometrical spot patterns.

This analysis ignored the possible presence of non-thermal emission from the millisecond pulsar. However, in the energy range used for the analysis (0.25-1.5 keV), non-thermal emission is unlikely to have a significant contribution (see for e.g., Guillot et al. 2016). Moreover, no such thermal emission has been detected in the X-ray spectrum of this pulsar (Bogdanov et al. 2008)

The radio timing of the pulsar provided a prior on the pulsar distance (see Fonseca et al. 2021). Specifically a Skewed-Normal distribution was used with parameters: skewnorm.pdf(D, 1.7, loc = 1.002, scale = 0.227). See Riley et al. 2021.

A prior on the interstellar absorption was used in this analysis, with a neutron hydrogen column density Nh in the range 0 to 10x10^20 cm^-2, i.e, a flat prior (see discussion in Riley et al. 2021).

A prior on the pulsar mass resulted from the pulsar timing measurements of the Shapiro delay.  The mass of 2.08+/-0.04 Msun was used as a prior in this analysis. More specifically, a joint prior distribution with the inclination i was used (see Table 1 in Riley et al. 2021) since the mass and cos(i) are correlated in the analyses of Fonseca et al. 2021.
