ModelDependencyDescription,"The atmosphere model used in this analysis was calculated for low-temperature atmosphere (<10^5.5 K) and includes the effect of plasma.

The absorption of X-rays was calculated using absorption tables based on the tbabs model of Wilms et al. 2000 (updated in 2016).

The frequency-dependent reddening has been implemented based on results of Clayton et al. 2003 (Fig. 1).

The contribution of the two hot spots to the X-ray spectrum analysed (<0.3 keV) was included using 2 blackbody components.","The atmosphere model used in this analysis was calculated for low-temperature atmosphere (<10^5.5 K) and includes the effect of plasma.

AssumptionsDescription,"At the surface of a neutron star, elements stratify on time scales of minutes/hours leaving the lightest on top (Romani 1987). Also, the thickness of the last scattering layer of a NS is on the order of a few cm. Therefore, it is common to assume a single composition, being that of the lightest element. Hydrogen is therefore a reasonable assumption for the composition, especially for a NS that has accreted matter from a companion star. Other effects are in competition and may put some uncertainties on the surface composition, namely, accretion from the interstellar medium, diffuse nuclear burning of light of H into He (Chang & Bildsten 2003, 2004), and spallation of heavier elements into lighter ones (Bildsten et al. 1992).

This analyses also assume emission from a low-magnetic field neutron stars (as typically measured for MSPs, specifically B_dip ~ 2.8e8 G for PSR J0437-4715). The atmosphere model is that of a non-magnetised atmosphere, which is a good approximation as B-field effect (modified opacities) become important above 1e10 G (Kaminker et al., 1983; Zavlin et al., 1996). However, this neglects potential high-magnetic loop near the NS surface.

The relativistic effects of rotation on the emergent spectrum are neglected in this analysis. However, the effects on the radius are < 1 km at the rotational frequency of PSR J0437-4715 (173.6 Hz), see Baubock et al. 2015). 

The analysis assumes that the full surface is emitting uniformly at the same temperature (modulo the contribution of the hot spots).

The modelling of the x-ray absorption (with the tbabs model) assumes solar abundances for the interstellar medium, a reasonable assumption for a pulsar located at 156 pc.

The radio timing of the pulsar provided priors on the pulsar mass (1.44Msun), see Reardon et al. 2016. No uncertainties on this measurement was included in the analysis. 

The radio timing of the pulsar provided priors on the pulsar distance (156.79 pc), see Reardon et al. 2016. No uncertainties on this measurement was included in the analysis.

The reddening was also provided as a prior, using estimation for Galactic dust maps: E(B-V) = 0.002+/-0.014 (Lallement et al. 2018).

Also, the thickness of the last scattering layer of a NS is on the order of a few cm. Therefore, it is common to assume a single composition, being that of the lightest element. If no Hydrogen is present in the system, the next expected element is Helium, which is a possibility if the NS has accreted only Helium from a companion star.
