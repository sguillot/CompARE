AssumptionsDescription,"At the surface of a neutron star, elements stratify on time scales of minutes/hours leaving the lightest on top (Romani 1987). Also, the thickness of the last scattering layer of a NS is on the order of a few cm. Therefore, it is common to assume a single composition, being that of the lightest element. Hydrogen is therefore a reasonable assumption for the composition, especially for a NS that has accreted matter from a companion star. Other effects are in competition and may put some uncertainties on the surface composition, namely, accretion from the interstellar medium, diffuse nuclear burning of light of H into He (Chang & Bildsten 2003, 2004), and spallation of heavier elements into lighter ones (Bildsten et al. 1992).

This analyses also assume emission from a low-magnetic field neutron stars as expected for low-mass X-ray binaries (Di Salvo & Burderi 2003), however not measured for quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters. The atmosphere model is that of a non-magnetised atmosphere, which is a good approximation as B-field effect (modified opacities) become important above 1e10 G (Kaminker et al., 1983; Zavlin et al., 1996).

The relativistic effects of rotation on the emergent spectrum are neglected in this analysis. However, in the absence of detected pulsations, the rotation frequency for this neutron star is unknown, and the the effects of rotation on the radius may reach a few percent, see Baubock et al. 2015. 

The analysis assumes that the full surface is emitting uniformly at the same temperature. However, if the presence of hot regions are neglected, this can bias the measurement of the size of the emitting area (Elshamouty et al. 2016), see discussion in Echiburú et al. 2020.

The modelling of the x-ray absorption (with the tbabs model) assumes solar abundances for the interstellar medium.

The distance to the globular cluster M13 (d = 7.7 kpc) used in this analysis was obtained from a systematic study of Galactic globular cluster (population synthesis and dynamical studies, McLaughlin & van der Marel 2005).

To account for the uncertainties in the calibration between detectors, the authors employed cross-calibration multiplicative factors (often used in joined X-ray spectral analyses between data from multiple detectors/telescopes).","At the surface of a neutron star, elements stratify on time scales of minutes/hours leaving the lightest on top (Romani 1987). Also, the thickness of the last scattering layer of a NS is on the order of a few cm. Therefore, it is common to assume a single composition, being that of the lightest element.

The analysis assumes that the full surface is emitting uniformly at the same temperature. However, if the presence of hot regions are neglected, this can bias the measurement of the size of the emitting area (Elshamouty et al. 2016), see discussion in Echiburú et al. 2020.

The modelling of the x-ray absorption (with the tbabs model) assumes solar abundances for the interstellar medium.

The distance to the globular cluster M30 (d = 8.2 +/- 0.62 kpc, O'Malley et al 2017) used in this analysis was obtained from the main sequence fitting method, and the uncertainties include all sources of uncertainties (theoretical, photometric, metallicity and reddening estimates, O'Malley et al 2017).","At the surface of a neutron star, elements stratify on time scales of minutes/hours leaving the lightest on top (Romani 1987). Also, the thickness of the last scattering layer of a NS is on the order of a few cm. Therefore, it is common to assume a single composition, being that of the lightest element. If no Hydrogen is present in the system, the next expected element is Helium, which is a possibility if the NS has accreted only Helium from a companion star. Other effects are in competition and may put some uncertainties on the surface composition, namely, accretion from the interstellar medium, diffuse nuclear burning of light of H into He (Chang & Bildsten 2003, 2004), and spallation of heavier elements into lighter ones (Bildsten et al. 1992).

This analyses also assume emission from a low-magnetic field neutron stars as expected for low-mass X-ray binaries (Di Salvo & Burderi 2003), however not measured for quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters. The atmosphere model is that of a non-magnetised atmosphere, which is a good approximation as B-field effect (modified opacities) become important above 1e10 G (Kaminker et al., 1983; Zavlin et al., 1996).

The relativistic effects of rotation on the emergent spectrum are neglected in this analysis. However, in the absence of detected pulsations, the rotation frequency for this neutron star is unknown, and the the effects of rotation on the radius may reach a few percent, see Baubock et al. 2015.

To account for the uncertainties in the calibration between detectors, the authors employed cross-calibration multiplicative factors (often used in joined X-ray spectral analyses between data from multiple detectors/telescopes).","At the surface of a neutron star, elements stratify on time scales of minutes/hours leaving the lightest on top (Romani 1987).
