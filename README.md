# CompARE

Repository of observational constraints on the dense matter equation of state from neutron stars.

We recommend the developer to work on a local version of CompARE.
To do so, simply run:

$ bash install.sh

It creates a local copy of CompARE in the folder $HOME/mylib with the following files and folders:

### /data/

Containts the data files (organized by type of source)

### /docs/

Contains tutorials. Also contains files for 'Looping' (database development software)

## /scripts/

Contains the scripts (plotting, fetching data, managing database)

## requirements.txt

Contains the list of requirements to run the scripts in the CompARE library.

## requirementsDjango.txt

Contains the list of requirements to run the web app of CompARE.

## README.md

It is the present file.

## /webpage/

Contains the web app and the database interface files.
